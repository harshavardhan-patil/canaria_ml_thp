    "## Transitivity Analysis\n",
    "1. Transitivity measures how consistently your system identifies duplicates across the entire dataset, not just in isolated pairs.\n",
    "2. Transitivity is a fundamental property of well-behaved similarity measures. In a proper vector space, if A is similar to B and B is similar to C, then A should be similar to C. This makes it mathematically sound.\n",
    "3. We are measuring how many triplets maintain the transitive property out of all available triplets\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a transitivity score of 88.39 % at 0.95 threshold. This score suggests that 0.95 strikes a good balance - not too strict (which would yield very high transitivity but miss many duplicates) nor too lenient (which would capture more duplicates but have poor transitivity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawback\n",
    "Transitivity, by definition, needs triplets, which means we are missing analysis on jobs that were found only twice."
